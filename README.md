Welcome to the repository for the official launcher for fan game [Pok√©mon Apex](https://apex.baph.xyz). This launcher is written in C# for Windows.

## Issues
If you have found an issue or have a suggestion about the **launcher only**, please report them here. If you would like to contribute code, feel free to submit a pull request for review.

## Antivirus
Some antivirus programs can interfere with the launcher running or display a false virus warning. You may need to manually allow or whitelist the launcher in your antivirus settings. Please do not report such issues, as I have no control over them and do not provide tech support.
